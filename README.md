# PGL_for_PartialDischarge

Planar Goubau Line Antennas (PGLs) at THz frequencies are used for molecular spectroscopy, a
technique that has opened up new possibilities for near-field biomolecular spectroscopy.

In this project PGLs for partial discharge have been designed using CST studio, fabricated and
measured for GHz frequencies to better understand the properties of PGLs at THz waves used for
molecular spectroscopy.

Conclusively electromagnetic simulations were used for the design and analysis of the structures to
achieve an accurate simulation environment.
